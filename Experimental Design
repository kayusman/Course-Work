## 📘 Overview
This study explores how **treatment type** and **patient age group** affect **blood glucose levels** in diabetic patients. The work applies a **3² factorial experimental design** to test for main and interaction effects between treatment methods and age categories.

---

## 🎯 Research Objectives
1. Determine whether treatment type significantly affects blood glucose levels.  
2. Examine whether age group influences blood glucose levels.  
3. Assess if an interaction exists between treatment type and age group in influencing blood glucose levels.

## 🔬 Study Design

### 1. Factors and Levels
| Factor | Description | Levels |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Treatment Type | Type of diabetes management | Oral medication, Insulin therapy, Combined therapy |
| Age Group | Patient age categories | 18–30 years, 31–50 years, 51–70 years |

Each combination was tested with **5 replicates**, yielding **45 total observations**.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1. Model Specification
A **3² factorial design** was used.  
The model is expressed as:

\[
Y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + (\alpha\beta)_{ij} + \varepsilon_{ijk}
\]

Where:
- \( \mu \): Overall mean  
- \( \alpha_i \): Effect of Treatment Type  
- \( \beta_j \): Effect of Age Group  
- \( (\alpha\beta)_{ij} \): Interaction effect  
- \( \varepsilon_{ijk} \): Random error term, \( \varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2) \)

### 2. Hypothesis Tests
| Effect | Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)) | Alternative (\(H_a\)) |
|--------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| Treatment Type | \( \alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \alpha_3 = 0 \) | At least one \( \alpha_i \neq 0 \) |
| Age Group | \( \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \beta_3 = 0 \) | At least one \( \beta_j \neq 0 \) |
| Interaction | \( (\alpha\beta)_{ij} = 0 \) for all i,j | At least one \( (\alpha\beta)_{ij} \neq 0 \) |

Significance level: **α = 0.05**

## 🧮 Statistical Analysis

### F-Ratios
- For Treatment Type (Factor A):  
  \[
  F_A = \frac{MS_A}{MS_E}
  \]
- For Age Group (Factor B):  
  \[
  F_B = \frac{MS_B}{MS_E}
  \]
- For Interaction:  
  \[
  F_{AB} = \frac{MS_{AB}}{MS_E}
  \]

Where each mean square is computed from its corresponding sum of squares (SSA, SSB, SSAB, SSE).

## 📊 Results

### Model Summary
- **F(8, 34) = 3.03**, **p = 0.0111**  
✅ The overall model is statistically significant at the 5% level.

### ANOVA Findings
| Source | DF | F-value | P-value | Significance |
|---------|----|----------|----------|---------------|
| Treatment Type | 2 | — | < 0.05 | ✅ Significant |
| Age Group | 2 | — | > 0.05 | ❌ Not significant |
| Interaction | 4 | — | > 0.05 | ❌ Not significant |

➡ **Only Treatment Type** has a significant main effect on blood glucose levels.  
➡ No significant interaction effect exists.

## 📈 Model Validation

### Normality of Residuals
The **QQ plot** shows mild deviations from normality, with residuals scattered around the reference line — indicating approximate normal behavior with minor skew.

### Residual vs Predicted Plot
No major heteroscedastic pattern observed, supporting model adequacy.

## 🔍 Post Hoc Analysis

Since Treatment Type was significant, **Tukey’s HSD** test was conducted for pairwise comparisons.

| Comparison | Significance | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Treatment 1 vs Treatment 2 | ✅ Significant | Treatment 2 differs notably |
| Treatment 1 vs Treatment 3 | ❌ Not significant | Similar effect |
| Treatment 2 vs Treatment 3 | ✅ Significant | Treatment 2 most effective |

**Conclusion from Post Hoc:**  
- **Treatment 2** significantly differs from both 1 and 3.  
- **Treatments 1 and 3** do not differ significantly.

---

## 🧠 Discussion

- The ANOVA confirmed **treatment type** significantly affects blood glucose levels.  
- **Age group** and **interaction effects** were not significant.  
- The model fit was strong (p < 0.05).  
- The residual plots indicated the model assumptions were reasonably satisfied.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This study demonstrates that:
- Treatment type has a statistically significant effect on post-treatment glucose levels.  
- No evidence suggests that patient age group or the interaction between age and treatment type affects glucose levels.  
- Post hoc results highlight that **Treatment 2** produces the most distinct (and likely most effective) glucose control outcome.

**Implications:**  
These findings underscore the importance of tailoring treatment strategies based primarily on treatment modality rather than age.
